      <h1>BCI Safety – Concept Note</h1>
      <p class="muted">
        This Concept Note is an <b>independent, descriptive framing</b> of <b>“BCI safety”</b> for boards,
        regulators, risk leaders and ethics committees. It does not represent any official standard,
        authority or regulatory body, and it does not provide clinical, medical or legal advice.
        It simply outlines how the expression <b>BCI Safety</b> can be used as a <b>neutral banner</b> to
        structure governance, ethics and risk discussions around brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>1. Definition</h2>
      <p>
        In this note, <b>“BCI safety”</b> refers to the set of <b>safeguards, governance practices and
        oversight mechanisms</b> designed to prevent or mitigate harms arising from the design,
        deployment and use of <b>brain-computer interfaces (BCIs)</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        BCIs are technologies that <b>record and/or stimulate neural activity</b> to enable interaction
        between the brain and digital systems. They span <b>invasive medical implants</b>,
        <b>non-invasive clinical systems</b> and a growing ecosystem of <b>consumer / wellness devices</b>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        From a board and regulator perspective, BCI safety can be understood as the ability to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Protect <b>physical, psychological and cognitive integrity</b> of individuals using BCIs.</li>
        <li>Safeguard <b>neural and cognitive data</b> against misuse, re-identification or manipulation. </li>
        <li>Ensure that <b>AI components</b> within BCIs behave in line with safety, robustness and fairness expectations. </li>
        <li>Respect emerging notions of <b>neurorights</b> such as mental privacy, cognitive liberty and psychological continuity. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The term “BCI safety” is therefore not a clinical label, but a <b>cross-cutting governance
        vocabulary</b> that boards, supervisors and standard-setting bodies may adopt to organise
        their expectations and risk appetite around BCIs.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>2. Context and drivers</h2>
      <p>
        Advances in AI-enabled neurotechnology and brain-data decoding are accelerating.
        Research prototypes demonstrate the ability to <b>reconstruct speech, images or intentions
        from neural activity</b>, raising profound questions around privacy and autonomy. 
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, BCI applications are moving:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>from <b>strictly clinical contexts</b> (e.g. assistive communication for paralysis)</li>
        <li>towards <b>consumer, workplace and defence environments</b>, often outside traditional
            medical / device regulation. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Public and regulatory attention is converging on the need for <b>governance frameworks</b>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>UNESCO</b> and other international bodies are developing <b>global ethical standards</b> for neurotechnology,
          emphasising mental privacy, freedom of thought and protection against intrusive uses of neural data. 
        </li>
        <li>
          The <b>OECD</b> has issued a Recommendation on Responsible Innovation in Neurotechnology and a
          <b>Neurotechnology Toolkit</b> to guide governments on safety, autonomy and data protection. 
        </li>
        <li>
          The <b>Council of Europe</b> and UN human rights bodies are examining whether existing human rights
          protections are sufficient or whether new rights related to mental privacy and cognitive liberty
          are needed for neurotechnologies. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Several jurisdictions are starting to treat <b>neural data as sensitive data</b> and to enact specific
          protections in consumer and data-protection law. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Sector-specific regulators (for example medical device agencies) have begun to issue guidance
          on clinical BCI trials, non-clinical testing and safety risk control mechanisms. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In this evolving landscape, a <b>clear, neutral expression</b> such as “BCI Safety” can help boards,
        supervisors and alliances to align expectations, map initiatives and avoid fragmentation
        across multiple parallel terminologies.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>3. Possible uses of this framing</h2>
      <p>
        The expression <b>BCI Safety</b> could be used as an <b>umbrella phrase</b> to organise different strands
        of work around BCIs. Without prescribing any specific model, this framing may help boards,
        regulators and expert communities to:
      </p>

      <h3>3.1. Governance and oversight</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Structure <b>board-level discussions</b> on where BCIs are used or envisaged in the organisation,
          and what risk appetite is acceptable.
        </li>
        <li>
          Define <b>lines of accountability</b> between clinical leadership, CIO/CTO, CISO, ethics committees
          and external partners.
        </li>
        <li>
          Map how BCI projects connect with <b>existing AI governance, cybersecurity, safety and data
          protection frameworks</b>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3.2. Risk and safety frameworks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Develop internal or sectoral <b>risk taxonomies</b> for BCIs (physical, psychological, data, AI,
          employment, discrimination).
        </li>
        <li>
          Design <b>safety by design checklists</b> and <b>pre-deployment assessments</b> for BCI projects,
          including escalation paths for high-risk use cases.
        </li>
        <li>
          Align BCI control plans with broader <b>AI safety</b> or <b>neurotechnology governance charters</b>
          adopted at national or international level. 
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3.3. Auditability, logs and incident learning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Specify expectations around <b>logging, audit trails and monitoring</b> for BCI-related systems,
          especially when AI models adapt over time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Encourage the creation of <b>near-miss and incident repositories</b> to capture early signals of
          safety issues and support learning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Clarify when and how <b>independent audits</b> or expert reviews should be triggered for
          high-impact deployments.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3.4. Multi-stakeholder dialogue</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Convene <b>multi-stakeholder fora</b> (patients, workers, clinicians, engineers, ethicists,
          regulators, civil-society groups) under a shared “BCI Safety” heading.
        </li>
        <li>
          Support the creation of <b>public–private observatories</b> or <b>alliances</b> focused on responsible
          development and use of BCIs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provide a recognisable label for communication with <b>insurers, investors and rating agencies</b>
          interested in systemic and liability risks.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In all cases, this note considers “BCI Safety” as a <b>descriptive, optional vocabulary</b>, not as
        a mandatory standard or a certification mark.

      <h2>4. Limitations of this note</h2>
      <p>
        This Concept Note has <b>strict limitations</b>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It is <b>not</b> an official standard, guideline or charter, and has no regulatory status.
        </li>
        <li>
          It does <b>not</b> replace applicable law, medical-device regulations, human-rights instruments
          or data-protection rules.
        </li>
        <li>
          It does <b>not</b> provide clinical protocols, medical guidance or professional practice
          recommendations for BCI research or treatment. 
        </li>
        <li>
          It does <b>not</b> address the full scientific and technical complexity of BCI design,
          testing and deployment.
        </li>
        <li>
          It remains intentionally <b>high-level</b> and focuses on language and governance framing rather
          than implementation details.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Organisations considering BCIs should build their own frameworks drawing on
        <b>specialist clinical, ethical, legal, human-rights and technical expertise</b> and on the official
        guidance published by competent authorities.
